#+TITLE: Guix and GuixSD Logotypes

* Introduction

The SVG files in this directory are the original logotypes of the GNU
Guix package manager and the Guix System Distribution (GuixSD).

Each file contains color, black and white, and other variants of a
logo.  Open the SVG files with Inkscape to see which variant is better
for your needs.

The logos may be available for different media: screen, print,
etc. For example, the "GuixSD.svg" file contains the logo with colors
in a range appropriate for computer screens (RGB); "GuixSD-print.svg"
contains the logo with colors in a range generally appropriate for
printing. For other media, the logos may need to be prepared according
to the limitations of the printing device.
