Last week, I was in Manchester, UK, to attend the second conference of
Research Software Engineers, or [RSE 2017](http://rse.ac.uk/conf2017/)
for short.  I presented on the topic of [Reproducible and
user-controlled software management in HPC with GNU
Guix](http://rse.ac.uk/conf2017/talk-abstracts/#reproducible-and-user-controlled-software-management-in-hpc-with-gnu-guix).
The slides are [available
here](http://rse.ac.uk/conf2017/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/reproducible-and-user-controlled-software-management-in-hpc-with-gnu-guix-wurmus.pdf).
