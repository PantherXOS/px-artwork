# Abstract

[Everyday Use of GNU
Guix](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2018/program/proposals/526)

In this talk, I will introduce GNU Guix: a liberating, dependable, and
hackable package manager that follows the "purely functional software
deployment model" pioneered by Nix.

I will demonstrate some common use cases of Guix and show you how I
use it in my everyday life. In addition, I will briefly explain the
basic idea behind the functional model and how it enables Guix to
provide useful features like the following:

* Transactional upgrades and roll-back of installed software.
* Unprivileged users can simultaneously install multiple versions of
  software.
* Transparently build from source or download pre-built binaries.
* Installed software is bootstrappable, trustable, and auditable all
  the way down to your compiler's compiler.
* Eliminates an entire class of "works on my system" type problems.

No prior knowledge of Guix, Nix, or the functional model is
required. When you leave this talk, I hope you will have a basic
understanding of what Guix is, how to use it, and why it will help
make your life brighter.

# About GNU Guix

[GNUÂ Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix) is a transactional package
manager for the GNU system.  The Guix System Distribution or GuixSD is
an advanced distribution of the GNU system that relies on GNU Guix and
[respects the user's
freedom](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html).

In addition to standard package management features, Guix supports
transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management,
per-user profiles, and garbage collection.  Guix uses low-level
mechanisms from the Nix package manager, except that packages are
defined as native [Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile) modules,
using extensions to the [Scheme](http://schemers.org) language.  GuixSD
offers a declarative approach to operating system configuration
management, and is highly customizable and hackable.

GuixSD can be used on an i686, x86_64 and armv7 machines.  It is also
possible to use Guix on top of an already installed GNU/Linux system,
including on mips64el and aarch64.
