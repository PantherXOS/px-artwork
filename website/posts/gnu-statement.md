We, the undersigned GNU maintainers and developers, owe a debt of
gratitude to Richard Stallman for his decades of important work in the
free software movement.  Stallman tirelessly emphasized the importance
of computer user freedom and laid the foundation for his vision to
become a reality by starting the development of the GNU operating
system.  For that we are truly grateful.

Yet, we must also acknowledge that Stallman’s behavior over the years
has undermined a core value of the GNU project: the empowerment of
[_all_ computer users](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html#benefit).
GNU is not fulfilling its mission when the behavior of its leader
alienates a large part of those we want to reach out to.

We believe that Richard Stallman cannot represent all of GNU.  We
think it is now time for GNU maintainers to collectively decide about
the organization of the project.  The GNU Project we want to build is
one that _everyone_ can trust to defend their freedom.
