It’s been [ten years of
GNU Guix](/en/blog/2022/10-years-of-stories-behind-guix/)!  To
celebrate, and to share knowledge and enthusiasm, a [birthday
event](https://10years.guix.gnu.org) will take place on **September
16–18th, 2022**, in Paris, France.  The program is being finalized, but
you can [already register](https://10years.guix.gnu.org)!

This is a community event with several twists to it:

  - Friday, September 16th, is dedicated to **reproducible research
    workflows and high-performance computing** (HPC)—the focuses of the
    [Guix-HPC](https://hpc.guix.info) effort.  It will consist of talks
    and experience reports by scientists and practitioners.
  - Saturday targets **Guix and free software enthusiasts**, users and
    developers alike.  We will reflect on ten years of Guix, show what
    it has to offer, and present on-going developments and future
    directions.
  - on Sunday, users, developers, developers-to-be, and other
    contributors will **discuss technical and community topics** and
    join forces for hacking sessions, [unconference
    style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference).

[Check out the web site](https://10years.guix.gnu.org) and consider
registering as soon as possible so we can better estimate the size of
the birthday cake!

If you’re interested in presenting a topic, in facilitating a session,
or in organizing a hackathon, please get in touch with the organizers at
`guix-birthday-event@gnu.org` and we’ll be happy to make room for you.
We’re also looking for people to help with logistics, in particular
during the event; please let us know if you can give a hand.

Whether you’re a scientist, an enthusiast, or a power user, we’d love to
see you in September.  Stay tuned for updates!


#### About GNU Guix

[GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) is a transactional package manager and
an advanced distribution of the GNU system that [respects user
freedom](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html).
Guix can be used on top of any system running the Hurd or the Linux
kernel, or it can be used as a standalone operating system distribution
for i686, x86_64, ARMv7, AArch64 and POWER9 machines.

In addition to standard package management features, Guix supports
transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management,
per-user profiles, and garbage collection.  When used as a standalone
GNU/Linux distribution, Guix offers a declarative, stateless approach to
operating system configuration management.  Guix is highly customizable
and hackable through [Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile)
programming interfaces and extensions to the
[Scheme](http://schemers.org) language.
