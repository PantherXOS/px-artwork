Last week, I was at [GPCE
2017](https://conf.researchr.org/track/gpce-2017/gpce-2017-GPCE-2017),
an academic conference focused on generative programming techniques.  I
presented [_Code Staging in
GNU Guix_](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01580582/en), a paper that discusses
the motivation for and genesis of
[G-expressions](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/G_002dExpressions.html)
as well as recent improvements.  The slides are [available
here](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/guix-gpce-20171023.pdf).
