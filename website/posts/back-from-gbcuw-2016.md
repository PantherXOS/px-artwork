On the 12th of September, I attended the [German Bioinformatics Core
Unit Workshop](https://www.gbcuw.de/workshop/), a satellite workshop
on behalf of the German Conference on Bioinformatics (GCB) 2016.  I
gave a talk on the topic "Reproducible and User-Controlled Package
Management in HPC with GNU Guix".
