On the 23rd and 24th of July, Pjotr Prins and I visited Prague to
attend [BOSC 2017](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2017), the 18th
annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference.  We combined our short
talk slots to present the topics of "Reproducible bioinformatics
software with GNU Guix" and "Reproducible and user-controlled software
management in HPC with GNU Guix".  The organizers have uploaded a
[video recording of the talk here](https://youtu.be/cH6wCL6GeOQ).
