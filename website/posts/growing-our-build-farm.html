<p>
  We have received our new server for continuous builds of the GNU Guix
  system, and are putting the finishing touches on its installation.
  The machine is intended as an eventual replacement
  for <a href="https://hydra.gnu.org/">hydra.gnu.org</a>, a virtual
  machine kindly hosted by
  the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a>.
  The new machine will drive
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/donate/#hardware-donors">our
  build farm</a>, which continuously compiles the GNU system, and it
  will feed the mirror
  with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/manual/html_node/Substitutes.html">binary
  packages</a>, so that end users who do not wish to compile packages by
  themselves can easily keep up-to-date.  Time to report on the
  adventure! This first part covers the hardware.
</p>
<p>
  Buying the new machine has been made possible through a very generous
  donation by <a href="https://www.igalia.com/">Igalia</a>
  to <a href="http://enge.fr/blog/2016/03/foundation-of-guix-europe/">Guix
  Europe</a>. Igalia is a free software consultancy well known for its
  involvement in the development of the GNOME stack, GStreamer, the
  JavaScript compilers of Web
  browsers, <a href="https://www.igalia.com/areas/">and more</a>,
  promoting <a href="https://www.igalia.com/nc/about-us/">values</a>
  close to the GNU Guix project.  It is heartening that the company is
  helping us towards our goal of creating a free system that liberates
  its users to take their computing and data processing needs into their
  own hands!
</p>
<p>
  Of course, we wanted to buy the best for the money — but it turned out
  the best did not exist yet! Our goal was a system that would be as
  free as possible, starting from the BIOS, without backdoors
  of <a href="https://libreboot.org/faq/#intel">one kind</a>
  or <a href="https://libreboot.org/faq/#amd">another</a>; of course it
  also needed to be powerful enough to pilot our build farm, which is
  expected to grow with an ever increasing number of packages and maybe
  new architectures.  The <a href="https://libreboot.org/">Libreboot</a>
  project provides a free BIOS, which was in the process of being ported
  to the ASUS KGPE-D16 mainboard. Timothy Pearson from
  the <a href="https://www.coreboot.org/">Coreboot</a> project (on which
  Libreboot is based) worked hard to make the port a reality. We bought
  the machine from Thomas Umbach, owner
  of <a href="https://vikings.net/">VIKINGS</a>, a company selling
  complete servers based on this board and planning to provide hosting
  services on this platform. Thomas made us a very generous offer of
  only billing the parts, so we are grateful to VIKINGS as a second
  sponsor for this machine; independently, the close interaction with
  Thomas and his fast and helpful replies to our questions meant a very
  pleasant experience for a first-time buyer of a server machine!
  Hopefully, this will not be the last time either.
</p>
<p>
  The machine arrived carefully packaged in styrofoam and cardboard
  packaging with a power cable and the rails for mounting it in the rack
  of the hosting facility (for the time being, however, it is still
  sitting on a Moroccan pouffe in my living room, waiting for its
  installation to be finished).  It is 1U high to save hosting fees.  At
  the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/static/base/img/blog/20161110-server-front.jpg">front</a>, two USB
  ports, a power and a reset button.  At
  the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/static/base/img/blog/20161110-server-back.jpg">back</a>, more USB
  ports, Ethernet ports, a VGA and a serial port; apart from the latter,
  it does not look more exotic than my laptop.
</p>
<p>

       alt="Interior of the server."
       class="inline-image" />

  The interior looks very tidy to my untrained eyes.  This is not only a
  good sign for the vendor's professionalism, but according to Thomas
  also a necessity for ensuring sufficient air flow in the 1U case! This
  air flow is created by the array of five case fans on the right, in
  their orange housing. At the left, one can distinguish the two
  processors. We opted for the AMD Opteron 6262HE, which is free of
  backdoors to the best of our knowledge and power saving. Each of the
  processors has 16 cores, which should be amply enough for our needs
  (remember that the compilation of packages will take place on the
  build farm and not on this machine). Actually, only the processor fans
  and their big copper heatpipes are visible. There are 16 slots for
  memory, of which only four are used so far, each with a 16GB module
  for 64GB of total RAM — I do not think we will need to make use of our
  extension possibilities any time soon!  Two hard disks of 4TB each are
  hidden <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/static/base/img/blog/20161110-server-closeup.jpg">under
  the metal cover to the right</a>.
</p>
<p>
  So the hardware looks very neat, and in the next installment, we will
  have a look at the installation of GuixSD on it.

<p>
  Thanks again to all who made this adventure possible through their
  hard work and dedication, in
  particular <a href="https://www.igalia.com/">Igalia</a>, Thomas
  of <a href="https://vikings.net/">VIKINGS</a>, and Timothy of Coreboot
  and <a href="https://www.raptorengineering.com/">Raptor

<h4>About GNU Guix</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guix">GNU Guix</a> is a
  transactional package manager for the GNU system.  The Guix System
  Distribution or GuixSD is an advanced distribution of the GNU system
  that relies on GNU Guix
  and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html">respects
  the user's freedom</a>.<br /></p><p>In addition to standard package
  management features, Guix supports transactional upgrades and
  roll-backs, unprivileged package management, per-user profiles, and
  garbage collection.  Guix uses low-level mechanisms from the Nix
  package manager, except that packages are defined as
  native <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile">Guile</a> modules,
  using extensions to the <a href="http://schemers.org">Scheme</a>
  language.  GuixSD offers a declarative approach to operating system
  configuration management, and is highly customizable and
  hackable.<br />
</p>
<p>
  GuixSD can be used on an i686 or x86_64 machine.  It is also possible
  to use Guix on top of an already installed GNU/Linux system, including
  on mips64el and armv7.
