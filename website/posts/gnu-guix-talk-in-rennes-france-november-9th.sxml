In this talk, I will introduce functional package management and demonstrate Guix on practical use cases.  I will discuss the implications on (bit-)reproducible packages and environments, and how this can lead to verifiable binaries.  Lastly, we will see how this extends to whole-system deployments with GuixSD, the Guix System Distribution.")
