We are thrilled to announce that Magali L. Sacramento (IRC: `lemes`) will join Guix
as an [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org) intern over the next few months.

Magali will work on [adding a
subcommand](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2020-09/msg00108.html)
to Guix showing the history of all packages.  This will facilitate the use of
[`guix
time-machine`](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/guix.html#Invoking-guix-time_002dmachine)
and inferiors, as it will add support to easily search for a given package
version on all the defined channels.

Simon Tournier will be the primary mentor, with Gábor Boskovits co-mentoring, and the
whole community will undoubtedly help and provide guidance, as it has always done.

Welcome, and looking forward to work together!

## About GNU Guix

[GNU Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix) is a transactional package
manager and an advanced distribution of the GNU system that
[respects user freedom](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html).
Guix can be used on top of any system running the Hurd or the Linux
kernel, or it can be used as a standalone operating system distribution
for i686, x86_64, ARMv7, and AArch64 machines.

In addition to standard package management features, Guix supports
transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management,
per-user profiles, and garbage collection.  When used as a standalone
GNU/Linux distribution, Guix offers a declarative, stateless approach to
operating system configuration management.  Guix is highly customizable
and hackable through [Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile)
programming interfaces and extensions to the
[Scheme](http://schemers.org) language.
