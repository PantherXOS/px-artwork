     (p "In addition to standard package management features, Guix supports transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management, per-user profiles, and garbage collection.  Guix uses low-level mechanisms from the Nix package manager, except that packages are defined as native "
	(a (@ (href "http://www.gnu.org/software/guile")) "Guile")
	" modules, using extensions to the "

     (p "GuixSD can be used on an i686 or x86_64 machine.  It is also possible to use Guix on top of an already installed GNU/Linux system, including on mips64el and armv7."))))
