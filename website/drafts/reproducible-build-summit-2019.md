[years](https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2016/reproducible-build-summit-2nd-edition/),
the Reproducible Builds Summit has become this pleasant and fruitful
retreat where we Guix hackers like to go and share, brainstorm, and hack
with people from free software projects and companies who share this
interest in [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) and
related issues.  This year, several of us had the chance to be in
Marrakesh for [the fifth Reproducible Builds
Summit](https://reproducible-builds.org/events/Marrakesh2019/), which
was attended by about thirty people.

This blog post summarizes the (subjective!) takeaways from the different
sessions we attended, and introduces some of the cool hacks that came to
life on the roof top of the lovely riad that was home to the summit.

# Thanks!

We are grateful to everyone who made this summit possible: Gunner and
Evelyn of Aspiration, Hannes, Holger, Lamby, and Mattia, as well as our
kind hosts at Priscilla.  And of course, thanks to all fellow
participants whose openmindedness and focus made this both a productive
and a pleasant experience!

#### About GNU Guix

[GNU Guix](https://www.gnu.org/software/guix) is a transactional package
manager and an advanced distribution of the GNU system that [respects
user
freedom](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html).
Guix can be used on top of any system running the kernel Linux, or it
can be used as a standalone operating system distribution for i686,
x86_64, ARMv7, and AArch64 machines.

In addition to standard package management features, Guix supports
transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management,
per-user profiles, and garbage collection.  When used as a standalone
GNU/Linux distribution, Guix offers a declarative, stateless approach to
operating system configuration management.  Guix is highly customizable
and hackable through [Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile)
programming interfaces and extensions to the
[Scheme](http://schemers.org) language.
