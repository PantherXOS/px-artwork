As usual, GNU Guix will be present at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2022/)
this week-end, February 5th and 6th.  Due to the pandemic, FOSDEM takes
place on-line for the second year, but we’re confident the wires will be
able carry enthusiasm to the homes of the thousands of attendees.  We’re
happy to say that there will be several talks about Guix and related
projects!

  - Sunday morning, in the [distributions
    track](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/distributions/),
    co-maintainer and long-time hacker Mathieu Othacehe will present
    [“_Unify your distributions — How GNU Guix can run on any of your
    hardware_”](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/unify_your_distributions/)

The other talks will take place on Sunday as well, in the now
traditional track on [declarative and minimalistic
computing](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/declarative_and_minimalistic_computing/):

  - [“_A year of RISC-V adventures: embracing chaos in your software
    journey_”](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/riscvadventures/)
    will be Ekaitz Zarraga’s account of the heroic work porting
    GNU Guile, stage0, and GNU Mes to RISC-V, which will be instrumental
    in improving the RISC-V port of Guix.
  - With [_“Declare All Your Needs — Managing computing environment
    declaratively using
    GNU Guix”_](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/guixdeclare/),
    Andrew Tropin will show how you can declare your whole computing
    environment using [Guix
    System](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/System-Configuration.html),
    [Guix
    Home](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Home-Configuration.html),
    and [rde](https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/rde/).
  - In [“_GNU Guix behind the scene — Continuous integration for the
    GNU Guix
    project_”](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/gnuguixci/),
    Mathieu Othacehe will show what’s happening in the backyard of
    [Guix’s build farm](https://ci.guix.gnu.org).
  - [“_Concise Common Workflow Language — Concision and elegance in a
    workflow language using
    Lisp_”](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/commonworkflowlang/)
    will be Arun Isaac presenting [the all new
    ccwl](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/commonworkflowlang/), a
    Guile domain-specific language (DSL) to define scientific workflows.

But let’s be clear: there are other [exciting talks in this
track](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/declarative_and_minimalistic_computing/),
some of which closely related to Guix and Guile, so do not miss out!

As in previous years, we are also organizing a [two-day on-line
event](https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2022/online-guix-days-2022-announcement-1/)
two weeks after FOSDEM.  If you’d like to share what you’ve done with
Guix or in Guix, if you have packaging stories from the trenches,
there’s *one week left to submit a talk*.  At any rate, whether you’re
simply curious about Guix or whether you’re already deep into, we hope
to see you on February, 19–20!

#### About GNU Guix

[GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) is a transactional package manager and
an advanced distribution of the GNU system that [respects user
freedom](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html).
Guix can be used on top of any system running the Hurd or the Linux
kernel, or it can be used as a standalone operating system distribution
for i686, x86_64, ARMv7, AArch64 and POWER9 machines.

In addition to standard package management features, Guix supports
transactional upgrades and roll-backs, unprivileged package management,
per-user profiles, and garbage collection.  When used as a standalone
GNU/Linux distribution, Guix offers a declarative, stateless approach to
operating system configuration management.  Guix is highly customizable
and hackable through [Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile)
programming interfaces and extensions to the
[Scheme](http://schemers.org) language.
